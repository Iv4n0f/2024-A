    Oh, oh
    Oh, oh
    Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
    That you're alive and have a soul
    But it takes someone to come around
    To show you how

    She's the tear in my heart
    I'm alive
    She's the tear in my heart
    I'm on fire
    She's the tear in my heart
    Take me higher
    Than I've ever been

    Songs on the radio are okay
    My taste in music is your face
    But it takes a song to come around
    To show you how

    She's the tear in my heart
    I'm alive
    She's the tear in my heart
    I'm on fire
    She's the tear in my heart
    Take me higher
    Than I've ever been
    Than I've ever been
    Than I've ever been
    Than I've ever been

    Oh, than I've ever been
    You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
    But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
    I'm driving, here I sit, cursing my government
    For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
    You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
    But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
    I'm driving, here I sit, cursing my government
    For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
    
    Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
    That you're alive and have a soul, oh, oh
    But it takes someone to come around

    To show you how
    She's the tear in my heart
    I'm alive
    She's the tear in my heart
    I'm on fire
    She's the tear in my heart
    Take me higher
    Than I've ever been
    My heart is my armor
    She's the tear in my heart
    She's a carver
    She's a butcher with a smile
    Cut me farther
    Than I've ever been
    Than I've ever been
    Than I've ever been
    
    Oh, than I've ever been
    My heart is my armor
    She's the tear in my heart
    She's a carver
    She's a butcher with a smile
    Cut me farther
    Than I've ever been
